      <h2 class="hidden">Chapter 32. Wave optics</h2>
      <p>Electron microscopes can make images of individual atoms,
        but why will a visible-light microscope never be able to?
        Stereo speakers create the illusion of music that comes from
        a band arranged in your living room, but why doesn't the
        stereo illusion work with bass notes? Why are computer chip
        manufacturers investing billions of dollars in equipment to
        etch chips with x-rays instead of visible light?</p>

      <p>The answers to all of these questions have to do with the
        subject of wave optics. So far this book has discussed the
        interaction of light waves with matter, and its practical
        applications to optical devices like mirrors, but we have
        used the ray model of light almost exclusively. Hardly ever
        have we explicitly made use of the fact that light is an
        electromagnetic wave. We were able to get away with the
        simple ray model because the chunks of matter we were
        discussing, such as lenses and mirrors, were thousands of
        times larger than a wavelength of light. We now turn to
        phenomena and devices that can only be understood using the
        wave model of light.</p>

      <p>Figure <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch32/ch32.html#fig:double-slit-water-waves">a</a>
        shows a typical problem in wave optics, enacted
        with water waves. It may seem surprising that we don't get a
        simple pattern like figure <a
            href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch32/ch32.html#fig:double-slit-no-diffraction">b</a>, but
        the pattern would only
        be that simple if the wavelength was hundreds of times
        shorter than the distance between the gaps in the barrier
        and the widths of the gaps.</p>

      <p>Wave optics is a broad subject, but this example will help
        us to pick out a reasonable set of restrictions to make
        things more manageable:</p>

      <p>(1) We restrict ourselves to cases in which a wave travels
        through a uniform medium, encounters a certain area in which
        the medium has different properties, and then emerges on the
        other side into a second uniform region.</p>

      <p>(2) We assume that the incoming wave is a nice tidy
        sine-wave pattern with wavefronts that are lines (or, in
        three dimensions, planes).</p>

      <p>(3) In figure <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch32/ch32.html#fig:double-slit-water-waves">a</a>
        we can see that the wave pattern
        immediately beyond the barrier is rather complex, but
        farther on it sorts itself out into a set of wedges
        separated by gaps in which the water is still. We will
        restrict ourselves to studying the simpler wave patterns
        that occur farther away, so that the main question of
        interest is how intense the outgoing wave is at a given angle.</p>

      <p>The kind of phenomenon described by restriction (1) is
        called <i>diffraction</i>. Diffraction
        can be defined as the behavior of a wave when it encounters
        an obstacle or a nonuniformity in its medium. In general,
        diffraction causes a wave to bend around obstacles and make
        patterns of strong and weak waves radiating out beyond the
        obstacle. Understanding diffraction is the central problem
        of wave optics. If you understand diffraction, even the
        subset of diffraction problems that fall within restrictions
        (2) and (3), the rest of wave optics is icing on the cake.</p>

      <p>Diffraction can be used to find the structure of an unknown
        diffracting object: even if the object is too small to study
        with ordinary imaging, it may be possible to work backward
        from the diffraction pattern to learn about the object. The
        structure of a crystal, for example, can be determined from
        its x-ray diffraction pattern.</p>

      <p>Diffraction can also be a bad thing. In a telescope, for
        example, light waves are diffracted by all the parts of the
        instrument. This will cause the image of a star to appear
        fuzzy even when the focus has been adjusted correctly. By
        understanding diffraction, one can learn how a telescope
        must be designed in order to reduce this problem ---
        essentially, it should have the biggest possible diameter.</p>

      <p>There are two ways in which restriction (2) might commonly
        be violated. First, the light might be a mixture of
        wavelengths. If we simply want to observe a diffraction
        pattern or to use diffraction as a technique for studying
        the object doing the diffracting (e.g., if the object is too
        small to see with a microscope), then we can pass the light
        through a colored filter before diffracting it.</p>

      <p>A second issue is that light from sources such as the sun or
        a lightbulb does not consist of a nice neat plane wave,
        except over very small regions of space. Different parts of
        the wave are out of step with each other, and the wave is
        referred to as <i>incoherent</i>. One way
        of dealing with this is shown in figure <a
            href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch32/ch32.html#fig:double-slit-setup">c</a>. After
        filtering
        to select a certain wavelength of red light, we pass the
        light through a small pinhole. The region of the light that
        is intercepted by the pinhole is so small that one part of
        it is not out of step with another. Beyond the pinhole,
        light spreads out in a spherical wave; this is analogous to
        what happens when you speak into one end of a paper towel
        roll and the sound waves spread out in all directions from
        the other end. By the time the spherical wave gets to the
        double slit it has spread out and reduced its curvature, so
        that we can now think of it as a simple plane wave.</p>

      <p>If this seems laborious, you may be relieved to know that
        modern technology gives us an easier way to produce a
        single-wavelength, coherent beam of light: the laser.</p>

      <p>The parts of the final image on the screen in <a
          href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch32/ch32.html#fig:double-slit-setup">c</a> are called
        diffraction fringes.
        The center of each fringe is a point of maximum brightness,
        and halfway between two fringes is a minimum.</p>

      the structure of a crystal? Sound waves are used to make

      <h2>32.2 Scaling of diffraction</h2>

      <p>This chapter has “optics” in its title, so it is nominally
        about light, but we started out with an example involving
        water waves. Water waves are certainly easier to visualize,
        but is this a legitimate comparison? In fact the analogy
        works quite well, despite the fact that a light wave has a
        wavelength about a million times shorter. This is because
        diffraction effects scale uniformly. That is, if we enlarge
        or reduce the whole diffraction situation by the same
        factor, including both the wavelengths and the sizes of the
        obstacles the wave encounters, the result is still a valid solution.</p>

      <p>This is unusually simple behavior! In the first book of this
        series we saw many examples of more complex scaling, such as
        the impossibility of bacteria the size of dogs, or the need
        for an elephant to eliminate heat through its ears because
        of its small surface-to-volume ratio, whereas a tiny shrew's
        life-style centers around conserving its body heat.</p>

      <p>Of course water waves and light waves differ in many ways,
        not just in scale, but the general facts you will learn
        about diffraction are applicable to all waves. In some ways
        it might have been more appropriate to insert this chapter
        at the end of book 3, Vibrations and Waves, but many of the
        important applications are to light waves, and you would
        probably have found these much more difficult without any
        background in optics.</p>

      <p>Another way of stating the simple scaling behavior of
        diffraction is that the diffraction angles we get depend
        only on the unitless ratio λ/d, where λ is
        the wavelength of the wave and <i>d</i> is some dimension of the
        diffracting objects, e.g., the center-to-center spacing
        between the slits in figure <a
            href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch32/ch32.html#fig:double-slit-water-waves">a</a>. If, for
        instance, we scale
        up both λ and <i>d</i> by a factor of 37, the ratio
        λ /<i>d</i> will be unchanged.</p>

      <h2>32.3 The correspondence principle</h2>

        <figcaption>e / Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695).</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The only reason we don't usually notice diffraction of light
        in everyday life is that we don't normally deal with objects
        that are comparable in size to a wavelength of visible
        light, which is about a millionth of a meter. Does this mean
        that wave optics contradicts ray optics, or that wave optics
        sometimes gives wrong results? No. If you hold three fingers
        out in the sunlight and cast a shadow with them, <i>either</i>
        wave optics or ray optics can be used to predict the
        straightforward result: a shadow pattern with two bright
        lines where the light has gone through the gaps between your
        fingers. Wave optics is a more general theory than ray
        optics, so in any case where ray optics is valid, the two
        theories will agree. This is an example of a general idea
        enunciated by the physicist Niels Bohr,
        called the <i>correspondence
          principle: </i> when flaws in a physical theory lead to the
        creation of a new and more general theory, the new theory
        must still agree with the old theory within its more
        restricted area of applicability. After all, a theory is
        only created as a way of describing experimental observations.
        If the original theory had not worked in any cases at all,
        it would never have become accepted.</p>

      <p>In the case of optics, the correspondence principle tells us
        that when λ /<i>d</i> is small, both the ray and the wave
        model of light must give approximately the same result.
        Suppose you spread your fingers and cast a shadow with them
        using a coherent light source. The quantity λ /<i>d</i> is
        about 10 -4, so the two models will agree very closely. (To
        be specific, the shadows of your fingers will be outlined by
        a series of light and dark fringes, but the angle subtended
        by a fringe will be on the order of 10<sup>-4</sup> radians, so
        they will be invisible and washed out by the natural
        fuzziness of the edges of sun-shadows, caused by the
        finite size of the sun.)</p>

        <figcaption>m / Constructive interference along the center-line.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Returning to the example of double-slit diffraction, <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch32/ch32.html#fig:double-slit-water-waves-photo">f</a>,
note the strong visual impression of two overlapping sets of
concentric semicircles. This is an example of <i>Huygens' principle</i>, named after a Dutch physicist
and astronomer. (The first syllable rhymes with “boy.”)
Huygens' principle states that any wavefront can be broken
down into many small side-by-side wave peaks, <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch32/ch32.html#fig:huygens-1">g</a>, which
then spread out as circular ripples, <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch32/ch32.html#fig:huygens-2">h</a>, and by the
principle of superposition, the result of adding up these
sets of ripples must give the same result as allowing the
wave to propagate forward, <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch32/ch32.html#fig:huygens-3">i</a>. In the case of sound or
light waves, which propagate in three dimensions, the
“ripples” are actually spherical rather than circular, but
we can often imagine things in two dimensions for simplicity.</p>

<p>In double-slit diffraction the application of Huygens'
principle is visually convincing: it is as though all the
sets of ripples have been blocked except for two. It is a
rather surprising mathematical fact, however, that Huygens'
principle gives the right result in the case of an
unobstructed linear wave, <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch32/ch32.html#fig:huygens-2">h</a> and <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch32/ch32.html#fig:huygens-3">i</a>. A theoretically
infinite number of circular wave patterns somehow conspire
to add together and produce the simple linear wave motion
with which we are familiar.</p>

<p>Since Huygens' principle is equivalent to the principle of
superposition, and superposition is a property of waves,
what Huygens had created was essentially the first wave
theory of light. However, he imagined light as a series of
pulses, like hand claps, rather than as a sinusoidal wave.</p>

<p>The history is interesting. Isaac Newton
loved the atomic theory of matter so much that he searched
enthusiastically for evidence that light was also made of
tiny particles. The paths of his light particles would
correspond to rays in our description; the only significant
difference between a ray model and a particle model of light
would occur if one could isolate individual particles and
show that light had a “graininess” to it. Newton never did
this, so although he thought of his model as a particle
model, it is more accurate to say he was one of the builders
of the ray model.</p>

<p>Almost all that was known about reflection and refraction of
light could be interpreted equally well in terms of a
particle model or a wave
model, but Newton had one reason for strongly opposing
Huygens' wave theory. Newton knew
that waves exhibited diffraction, but diffraction of light
is difficult to observe, so Newton believed that light did
not exhibit diffraction, and therefore must not be a wave.
Although Newton's criticisms were fair enough, the debate
also took on the overtones of a nationalistic dispute
between England and continental Europe, fueled by English
resentment over Leibniz's supposed plagiarism of Newton's
calculus. Newton wrote a book on optics, and his prestige
and political prominence tended to discourage questioning of his model.</p>

<p>Thomas Young (1773-1829) was the person
who finally, a hundred years later, did a careful search for
wave interference effects with light and analyzed the
results correctly. He observed double-slit diffraction of
light as well as a variety of other diffraction effects, all
of which showed that light exhibited wave interference
effects, and that the wavelengths of visible light waves
were extremely short. The crowning achievement was the
demonstration by the experimentalist Heinrich Hertz and the theorist James Clerk
Maxwell that light was an
<i>electromagnetic</i> wave. Maxwell is said to have related
his discovery to his wife one starry evening and told her
that she was the only other person in the world who knew what starlight was.</p>

Huygens' principle. The most interesting question is how to
compute the angles such as X and Z where the wave
intensity is at a maximum, and the in-between angles like
Y where it is minimized. Let's measure all our angles
with respect to the vertical center line of the figure,
which was the original direction of propagation of the wave.</p>

<p>If we assume that the width of the slits is small (on the
order of the wavelength of the wave or less), then we can
imagine only a single set of Huygens ripples spreading out
from each one, <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch32/ch32.html#fig:double-slit-overlapping">l</a>. White lines represent peaks, black
ones troughs. The only dimension of the diffracting
slits that has any effect on the geometric pattern of the
overlapping ripples is then the center-to-center distance,
<i>d</i>, between the slits.</p>

<p>We know from our discussion of the scaling of diffraction
that there must be some equation that relates an angle like
θ<sub><i>Z</i></sub> to the ratio λ /<i>d</i>,
</p><div class="equation"><img src="./data/Wave optics_files/eq_41b338e3.png" alt=" frac{lambda}{d} leftrightarrow theta_Z qquad ."></div><p class="noindent">
If the equation for θ<sub><i>Z</i></sub> depended on some other
expression such as λ +<i>d</i> or λ<sup>2</sup>/<i>d</i>, then it
would change when we scaled λ and <i>d</i> by the same
factor, which would violate what we know about the
scaling of diffraction.</p>

<p>Along the central maximum line, X, we always have positive
waves coinciding with positive ones and negative waves
coinciding with negative ones. (I have arbitrarily chosen to
take a snapshot of the pattern at a moment when the waves
emerging from the slit are experiencing a positive peak.)
The superposition of the two sets of ripples therefore
results in a doubling of the wave amplitude along this line.
There is constructive interference. This is easy to explain,
because by symmetry, each wave has had to travel an equal
number of wavelengths to get from its slit to the center line, <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch32/ch32.html#fig:double-slit-path-length">m</a>:
Because both sets of ripples have ten wavelengths to cover in
order to reach the point along direction X, they will be in step when they get there.</p>

<p>At the point along direction Y shown in the same figure,
one wave has traveled ten wavelengths, and is therefore at a
positive extreme, but the other has traveled only nine and a
half wavelengths, so it at a negative extreme. There is
perfect cancellation, so points along this line experience no wave motion.</p>

<p>But the distance traveled does not have to be equal in order
to get constructive interference. At the point along
direction Z, one wave has gone nine wavelengths and the
other ten. They are both at a positive extreme.</p>
      <p class="self-check"><i>self-check:</i>At a point half a wavelength below the point marked along
direction X, carry out a similar analysis.
